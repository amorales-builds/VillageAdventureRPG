# Village Adveture RPG

*Small RPG game made for pseudo language: PSEINT*

+ This game was made by myself and three other collaborators for our 1st year Programming Logic class' final project.

+ I'm resposible for the batlle mechanics, the cyper encoder/decoder, and the general UI, plus bringing the whole game together with the parts contributed by the other group members.
